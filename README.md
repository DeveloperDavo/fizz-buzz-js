# Fizz buzz - JavaScript

This exercise is a demonstration of TDD in JavaScript using. I have also completed the exercise in [Java](https://github.com/learnitmyway/fizzBuzz)

## Task

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

## Article

[A really simple example of TDD](https://www.learnitmyway.com/tdd-example/):
A step by step introduction to Test Driven Development.

## Set up

- Install dependencies `npm install`

## Run checks

- lint and tests with `npm run precommit`

Notes:

- Prettier is included in the vscode settings but excluded from linting. I decided to do this so the editor doesn't get spammed with formatting errors.
